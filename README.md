# ODE-Final-Project
This repository contains Python code for simulating the long-term evolution of Spain’s electricity generation mix using a simplified system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The model represents five main technologies—fossil fuels, nuclear, wind, solar, and hydroelectric power—whose shares evolve over time according to replicator dynamics.
