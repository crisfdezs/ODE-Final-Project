# Modelling the Dynamics of Spain’s Electricity Generation Mix

This repository contains the Python code supporting the **final project for the course "Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations" (Fall 2025)**.  
The project studies the **long-term evolution of Spain’s electricity generation mix** using a simplified system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) based on **replicator dynamics**.

The model tracks the share of five electricity generation technologies: **Fossil fuels, Nuclear, Wind, Solar, and Hydroelectric power**. Each technology’s share evolves over time as a function of its payoff and growth rate, under the constraint of a fixed total electricity generation.

## Scenarios Implemented

1. **Baseline scenario**  
   Current energy mix with constant growth rates, representing the status quo.

2. **Renewable support scenario**  
   Models policies favoring renewable energy, increasing growth rates for wind and solar.

3. **Nuclear phase-out scenario**  
   Models a policy shock reducing nuclear energy growth after a given time, simulating a gradual phase-out.

Each scenario is computed using the `integrate` function from `solver.py` and visualized with `plot_energy_mix`.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x  
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

## Usage

To run all scenarios and generate plots:
```bash
python -m examples.main
```
---

## Notes

All Python scripts include detailed docstrings explaining inputs, outputs, and assumptions.

Figures generated by simulations can be saved to the figures/ folder for inclusion in the report.

The model assumes normalized shares for all energy sources (sum of shares = 1) and enforces non-negativity.
